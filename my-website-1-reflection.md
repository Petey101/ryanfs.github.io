- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  * Repositories on github is a place to host your code in the cloud so that it's accessable from anywhere. To create a repository, you can click a button which will make a new place for you to host a certain amount of code. Cloning it to your desktop means keeping a carbon copy of the code in that area on your computer so that you can make updates, which you'll eventually push back up.
- Describe what open source means.
  - Open source is when people host their code online for anyone to read, use, and install. The benefit of having open source code is that people can take that code and make updates to it so it does something new. It becomes a public utility at that point.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  - Since it's open, open source software is always vulnerable to attacks, but besides that disadvantage, I think it's utopia. It's an amazing movement that people release their work to the wild asking only for credit.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.
  - Using a license grants others the ability to use your work without having to seek permission (which can be very time consuming), while still protecting you as the original creator and making sure you get the credit for having created it.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  - Brancing on git was finally solidified for me during this challenge! Also the difference between licenses was a nice thing to solidify.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
