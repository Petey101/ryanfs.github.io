          <h2>Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages</h2>
          <p>Let's start off by defining the two terms, then jump into advantages and disadvantages of each type, and finally end off with our analysis.</p>
          <h3>Static Typed Language</h3>
          <p>When setting a variable in a static typed language, you have to know what type of variable it is when the code runs. This means that when you're for example saying <em>var number = 2</em>, you'll have to do <em>int var number = 2</em>, and explicitly state that the value of that variable is going to be an integer.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages &amp; Drawbacks</strong></p>
          <p>The advantage to writing it out explicitly is that Type Errors are caught earlier and more difficult to make. </p>
          <h3>Dynamic Typed Language</h3>
          <p>When setting variables in a dynamic language, you don't have to tell the compiler what type of value to expect, it will just know that 2 is an integer and 'test' is a string.</p>
          <p>the advantage here is that it's less verbose and quicker to write with dynamic programming languages. The drawback is that you run the risk of runtime Type Erros</p>
