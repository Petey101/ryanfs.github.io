          <h1>JS vs Ruby</h1>
          <h2>Ruby class v. JavaScript constructor functions</h2>
          <p>Constructor functions are different from classes in ruby because classes have a particular behavior that is set by multiple methods. Classes have lots of different properies that all get adjusted and manipulated by unique methods to that class.</p>
          <p>A Constructor function is the template for one function, and when it's called, it'll set up a new version of that function. </p>
