          <h2>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h2>
          <p>Margin is the amount of space outside of an element, it's used to position something at a certain distance from another element. Padding creates space inside the borders of an element, and blows up or shrinks the element. Border is the outline around an element and can have different styles, and different weights which are measured in pixels.</p>

          <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
          <p>Classes are used for any element that may require the same style in the future and should be used most often. IDs can only be used once per HTML doc. </p>
          <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?</h2>
          <p>Relative positioning takes an element and positions it based on the location of the other elements near it. Absolute positioning sticks something exactly where you set it on the page, and it will not affect the positioning of other elements. Fixed position is where you set it, relative to the viewport or browser window. Static positioning is the default, and will allow an element to move around as it normally would.</p>
          <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?</h2>
          <p>Inline elements can't have a set width or height, they don't respect top & bottom margin/padding. Block elements force a linebreak after the block element. Inline-block elements allow other elements to sit to their left and right. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189810/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block">stackoverflow diagram</a> was extremely helpful to learn the difference. </p>
