      There are a ton of benefits of version control. The main benefit is giving developers (or any type of creator) revision history of the changes they've made to files. If they need to revert to a previous more stable state, it's simple to do that.

        Git helps you keep track of changes by storing a history of the state of your system each time you commit your files to the git repository. By giving yourself lots of checkpoints, you can traverse through time if you need to make changes. It's beneficial for distributed teams because keeping track of changes helps everyone stay organized and prevents the chance of overwriting files.

        GitHub is a great place to store your code because it's so tightly integrated with the git system. It's free for public code, and it's social so anyone can find your code and you can find anyone else's code. It's also beneficial to use GitHub to store your code because your profile becomes a developer portfolio, potential employers can see all of the hard work you've done over the years.
